# Shanskar Bansal Portfolio - Design Brainstorm

## Approach 1: Cyberpunk AI Intelligence (Probability: 0.08)

**Design Movement**: Cyberpunk meets Data Visualization - inspired by sci-fi UI design and bleeding-edge tech aesthetics

**Core Principles**:
- High-contrast neon energy with dark, immersive backgrounds
- Data as visual language - animated particles, flowing lines, and digital patterns
- Hyper-futuristic typography with aggressive spacing and layering
- Glitch effects, scan lines, and digital distortion as design elements

**Color Philosophy**:
- Deep blacks and dark purples (background) with electric cyan, neon pink, and acid green accents
- Reasoning: Represents cutting-edge AI, digital intelligence, and political tech innovation
- Emotional intent: Powerful, disruptive, forward-thinking

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Asymmetric grid with diagonal cuts and angled sections
- Floating cards with parallax depth layers
- Staggered content reveals with overlapping sections
- Vertical timeline for projects (non-linear flow)

**Signature Elements**:
- Animated neural network particles (Three.js background)
- Glitch text effects on headings
- Neon border accents and scan-line overlays
- Digital circuit patterns and data visualization diagrams

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Aggressive hover states with scale and glow effects
- Click interactions trigger digital "activation" animations
- Scroll reveals content with staggered, snappy transitions
- Cursor becomes a crosshair with neon glow

**Animation**:
- Particle systems flowing across sections
- Glitch text animations on section headers
- Staggered card reveals with bounce-in effects
- Smooth scroll-based morphing of background elements
- Pulsing neon borders on hover

**Typography System**:
- Display: Bebas Neue (all-caps, ultra-bold, 1.2 letter-spacing) for headings
- Body: IBM Plex Mono (monospace, technical feel) for descriptions
- Accent: Montserrat Bold for section titles
- Hierarchy: Extreme contrast between sizes (72px → 12px)

## Approach 2: Minimalist Elegance with Cinematic Motion (Probability: 0.07)

**Design Movement**: Swiss Design meets Cinematic Storytelling - clean, sophisticated, film-like

**Core Principles**:
- Radical simplicity with maximum impact through motion
- Generous whitespace and breathing room between elements
- Cinematic camera movements and smooth transitions
- Storytelling through visual hierarchy and pacing

**Color Philosophy**:
- Soft white and light gray backgrounds with deep charcoal text
- Subtle accent colors: warm gold, soft blue, muted green
- Reasoning: Premium, trustworthy, professional yet creative
- Emotional intent: Sophisticated, thoughtful, human-centered

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Full-width sections with centered content
- Vertical scrolling with horizontal parallax layers
- Asymmetric image placement (left/right alternating)
- Breathing sections with 40-60% whitespace

**Signature Elements**:
- Large, bold typography with generous line-height
- Subtle gradient overlays on images
- Thin divider lines and subtle borders
- Floating text elements with depth

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Smooth, predictable animations (no jarring effects)
- Fade and scale transitions on scroll
- Subtle hover states (slight lift and shadow)
- Smooth scroll behavior with easing

**Animation**:
- Fade-in on scroll with staggered delays
- Parallax image movement (subtle, not extreme)
- Smooth text reveals from bottom
- Gentle scale animations on hover
- Smooth transitions between sections

**Typography System**:
- Display: Neue Haas Grotesk (elegant, geometric) for hero and section titles
- Body: Inter (clean, readable) for descriptions
- Accent: Montserrat Light for subtitles
- Hierarchy: Subtle size differences (56px → 14px)

## Approach 3: Brutalist Tech with Raw Energy (Probability: 0.06)

**Design Movement**: Brutalism meets Web3 Aesthetics - raw, unapologetic, boundary-pushing

**Core Principles**:
- Exposed structure and raw typography (no polish, intentional roughness)
- Bold, unconventional layouts breaking grid conventions
- Heavy use of negative space and stark contrasts
- Authentic, unfiltered presentation of content

**Color Philosophy**:
- Pure black and white with single bold accent (electric orange or deep red)
- Reasoning: Honest, direct, no-nonsense approach to tech
- Emotional intent: Rebellious, authentic, technically rigorous

**Layout Paradigm**:
- Broken grid with overlapping elements
- Unconventional text sizing and placement
- Diagonal and rotated elements
- Asymmetric sections with varied heights

**Signature Elements**:
- Heavy black borders and thick lines
- Raw, unsmoothed typography
- Overlapping text layers
- Stark geometric shapes and blocks

**Interaction Philosophy**:
- Abrupt, snappy interactions (no easing)
- Bold hover states with color inversion
- Click animations that feel "mechanical"
- Unpolished but intentional transitions

**Animation**:
- Snap-to-position animations (no smooth easing)
- Bold color flashes on interaction
- Rapid, energetic transitions
- Staggered reveals with sharp timing

**Typography System**:
- Display: Courier New or Roboto Mono (raw, technical) for all headings
- Body: Courier New (monospace, brutalist) for descriptions
- Accent: Bebas Neue for highlights
- Hierarchy: Extreme contrast with minimal middle ground
